# hello-world
A repository created during the github gentle introduction

I might as well create an actual hello world app in order to exercise my tool chain items such as a test framework, build tool, pre-processor, etc.

To Do:
1. create html, javascript, css files
2. create src and dist folders
3. get workflow tools working, such as minification, image optimization, "compile" javascript files, etc.
